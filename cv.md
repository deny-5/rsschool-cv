## *About Me*

I'm 27 years old. My current job is mine design technic and unfortunately for me,
it hasn't neither development possability nor sufficient income level nor even 
interes for me. Therefore, I am realy intended to get a craft that can provide me 
intresting and complex job tasks, and where my wealth level will depend on my skills.
At this moment I already did code for about one year but I did it as a hobby. I
tried several technologies for dive deeper on how computers work and what I can do
with their power. Computers inspire me much.

Now I start JS-FrontEnd cours and my goal is:

1. Get knowleges and skills that allow me to get a job as a software front-end developer
2. Turn my hobby in my new profession
3. Double increase my income next year
